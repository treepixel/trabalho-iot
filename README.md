# Sistema IoT para monitoramento ambiental com ESP8266 e DHT11

This is the source code of the development of a real-time temperature and humidity monitoring IoT system using the ESP8266 microcontroller with the sensor DHT11. The system was done using the programming language C++, Espressif's Software Development Kit, and the library UncleRus/esp-idf-lib to establish Wi-fi connectivity and enable data transmissions via the MQTT protocol. Additionally, the data of temperature and humidity are visualized through the Node-RED platform.
